# SteelCalc

**SteelCalc** is a Python package for structural engineers working with CSA S16:19. It includes a comprehensive set of functions to calculate factored resistances for tension, compression, shear, bending, block shear, seismic design, and more â€” all in accordance with CSA S16.

This package is designed for use in Jupyter notebooks and web applications, with support for rendered equations via the `handcalcs` and `IPython.display` libraries.
